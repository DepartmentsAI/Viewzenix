## [2023-07-31] Initial Technology Stack Selection

**Decision**: The Viewzenix platform will be built using Flask for the backend API, React for the frontend, and deployed on Fly.io.

**Context**: We needed to choose a technology stack that would support rapid development, provide good performance for webhook processing, and be easily maintainable.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Django + React
- FastAPI + Vue.js
- Node.js/Express + React
- Ruby on Rails + React

**Justification**: 
- Flask provides a lightweight framework suitable for API development with minimal overhead
- React offers a component-based architecture ideal for building complex dashboards
- This combination allows for separate frontend/backend development with clear interfaces
- Fly.io provides simple deployment with private networking capabilities required for security

**Consequences**:
- Team needs to ensure proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Must implement robust API contracts and validation
- Deployment pipeline needs to handle separate frontend and backend artifacts

**Involved Agents**: PM, BE, FE

**Related Artifacts**: 
- Requirements document: `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Architecture document (pending)

## [2023-08-01] Broker Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a broker adapter pattern with AlpacaAdapter as the first implementation.

**Context**: The system needs to interact with trading platforms to execute orders. We needed to determine how to structure this integration to support multiple brokers in the future.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct Alpaca API calls throughout the codebase
- Third-party library for broker integrations
- Custom adapter for each broker

**Justification**:
- Adapter pattern provides a clean interface for any broker implementation
- Isolates broker-specific code to make future additions easier
- Allows for complete mocking during testing
- Enables runtime switching between brokers based on configuration

**Consequences**:
- Additional upfront design and implementation time
- Need to define robust adapter interface that works for all potential brokers
- May require adapter-specific extensions for unique broker features

**Involved Agents**: BE, INT

**Related Artifacts**:
- Broker adapter interface design (pending)
- AlpacaAdapter implementation task (pending)
