## Decisions

### D001: Project Initialization
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Decision**: Established initial project structure and baseline documentation
- **Context**: Starting the Viewzenix project requires setting up the foundational elements according to the defined Core Rules
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Delaying documentation until after technical setup
  - Starting with a minimal structure and expanding as needed
- **Rationale**: 
  - Proper initialization with complete documentation ensures all agents begin with a shared understanding
  - Following the standard directory structure from the outset prevents later restructuring
- **Consequences**: 
  - Consistent project organization from the beginning
  - Clear reference documentation for all agents
  - Standards-compliant project structure
- **Agents Involved**: PM
- **Related Artifacts**: 
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/ROADMAP.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/PROJECT_PLAN.md`

### D002: Trading Webhook Platform Integration
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Decision**: Incorporate trading webhook platform functionality as the primary project focus
- **Context**: Received detailed specification in `trading_webapp_spec.md` outlining a webhook-based trading platform for processing TradingView alerts and executing trades through broker APIs
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Developing a generic web application without trading focus
  - Building trading functionality as a secondary feature rather than core function
  - Using a single technology stack (Node.js only) instead of adding Flask
- **Rationale**: 
  - Trading webhook platform provides clear, concrete functionality with well-defined requirements
  - Mixed technology approach (Node.js + Flask) leverages optimal tools for each component
  - Broker-agnostic design allows for future extensibility
- **Consequences**: 
  - Project now has a well-defined scope with specific deliverables
  - Development can proceed with clear architecture and component boundaries
  - Testing strategy must accommodate market-closed testing scenarios
  - Integration complexity increases with multiple technology stacks
  - Documentation and requirements updated to reflect trading focus
- **Agents Involved**: PM
- **Related Artifacts**: 
  - `/workspace/trading_webapp_spec.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/ROADMAP.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
  - `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
