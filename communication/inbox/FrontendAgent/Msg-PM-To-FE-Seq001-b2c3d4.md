  <subject>Project Initialization: React Dashboard Setup</subject>
  <content>
    Hello Frontend Agent,

    Now that the project planning documentation is in place, I'd like you to set up the initial React dashboard for the Viewzenix trading webhook platform. I'm creating GitHub Issue #2 for this task.

    **Task Summary**:
    - Set up the basic React project structure (using Next.js) for the Viewzenix frontend
    - Implement the basic dashboard layout with the following tabs:
      - Webhook Setup
      - Brokers
      - Bots
      - Logs
      - Analytics
    - Create placeholder components for each tab
    - Set up basic styling structure (either CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS)

    **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Project directory structure follows core rules in `/workspace/.cursor/rules/core_rules/020-directory-structure-always.mdc`
    - React application initializes without errors
    - Navigation structure includes all five required tabs
    - Responsive layout that works on desktop and tablet
    - Basic styling framework is in place
    - Common UI components are identified and stubbed out

    **Resources**:
    - Requirements document: `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`
    - Project plan: `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
    - Trading webapp spec: `/workspace/trading_webapp_spec.md`

    **Estimated Effort**: 2 PUs

    Please review the project documentation and the trading webapp specification to understand the requirements. Once you have set up the basic structure, create a feature branch named `feature/FE-001-react-setup` and commit your work. Then create a PR targeting the `develop` branch.

    The Backend Agent will be working concurrently on setting up the Flask API structure. For now, focus on the frontend structure and placeholders; we'll integrate with the backend API once both pieces are ready.

    Let me know if you have any questions or if you identify any blockers.

    Thank you,
    Project Manager
