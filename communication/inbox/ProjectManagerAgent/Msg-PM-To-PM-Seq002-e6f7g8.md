    Project Manager,
    
    Following project initialization, your next tasks focus on setting up project management infrastructure and coordinating the development team. Priority tasks:
    
    1. **Team Coordination (Ongoing)**
       - Initial task assignments have been distributed to all agents
       - Monitor progress and facilitate inter-agent coordination
       - Update project documentation as requirements evolve
    
    2. **GitHub Project Setup**
       - Repository created and project code pushed to master branch
       - GitHub Issues structure established for task tracking
       - Project board configured with appropriate columns (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
    
    3. **Sprint Planning**
       - Organize first sprint kickoff with all agents
       - Prioritize tasks across agents for first development iteration
       - Establish synchronization points for component integration
    
    4. **Documentation Management**
       - Continue refining architecture and API specifications based on implementation feedback
       - Maintain decision log for significant technical and architectural decisions
       - Ensure alignment between documentation and implementation
    
    Key coordination points:
    - Backend and Integration Agents need alignment on broker adapter interfaces
    - Frontend and Backend Agents require coordination on API consumption patterns
    - QA Agent needs input from all teams on testability approaches
    
    All initial agent messages have been sent to respective inboxes.
    
    GitHub repository has been created for the project and initial codebase pushed.
