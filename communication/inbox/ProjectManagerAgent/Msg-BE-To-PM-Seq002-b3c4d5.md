  <content>
    While waiting for feedback on the initial Flask API implementation, I've added OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to improve the API's usability. This enhancement includes:

    1. Added Swagger UI at `/api/docs` endpoint for interactive API documentation
    2. Created detailed API specification for all endpoints including:
       - TradingView webhook endpoint
       - Orders management endpoints
       - System status endpoint
       - Cleanup endpoint
       - Bot state management endpoints
    3. Updated project README.md with documentation information
    4. Added flask-swagger-ui to requirements.txt

    This documentation will make it easier for the Frontend and Integration agents to understand and use the API. The changes are committed to the feature/BE-002-api-documentation branch.

    Estimated effort consumed: 1 PU

    Please let me know if you would like any additional endpoints documented or if you have any feedback.
