  <subject>TASK_COMPLETE: React Dashboard Setup (Issue #2)</subject>
  <content>
    I've completed the initial React dashboard setup for the Viewzenix trading webhook platform. The implementation includes:

    - Project structure setup with Next.js
    - Dashboard layout with responsive navigation
    - Five tabs as specified (Webhook Setup, Brokers, Bots, Logs, Analytics)
    - Placeholder content for each tab section
    - Styling system using styled-components with design token variables
    - Mobile and desktop responsive layouts

    The code has been committed to the `feature/FE-001-react-setup` branch targeting the `develop` branch. The implementation follows the directory structure and design specifications as outlined in the project documentation.

    Consumed Effort: 2 PUs as estimated.

    Next steps would be to enhance the UI components for the webhook configuration screen and integrate with the backend APIs once they're available.
