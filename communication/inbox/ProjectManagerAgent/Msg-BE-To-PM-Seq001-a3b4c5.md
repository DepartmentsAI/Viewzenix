    I have completed the initial Flask API structure setup for the Viewzenix trading webhook platform as requested. This implementation includes:

    1. Flask project structure with blueprints for all required endpoints:
       - /webhook - For receiving TradingView alerts
       - /status - For system health monitoring
       - /orders - For order management
       - /cleanup - For orphaned order cleanup
       - /bot_state - For trading bot configuration

    2. Broker adapter pattern with:
       - BaseBrokerAdapter interface
       - AlpacaAdapter implementation

    3. Trade processing components:
       - TradingView alert schema validation
       - Trade classification (asset class, trade type)
       - Order size calculation

    4. Basic testing structure with pytest.

    5. Logging configuration using loguru.

    All code follows the required directory structure and coding standards. The implementation allows for receiving and processing TradingView webhook alerts and converting them into broker orders.

    Consumed PU: 1 PU as estimated.

    The code is committed to the feature/BE-001-flask-setup branch.
