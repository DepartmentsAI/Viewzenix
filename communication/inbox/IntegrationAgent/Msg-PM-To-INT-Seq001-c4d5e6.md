  <subject>Integration Agent Initial Tasks - Broker Integration Layer</subject>
  <content>
    Integration Agent,
    
    Your initial tasks focus on establishing the broker integration layer and API client framework. Please prioritize the following:
    
    1. **Broker Integration Architecture (5 PU)**
       - Define standardized interfaces for broker integration in `src/integration/brokers/`
       - Create adapter pattern structure for broker-agnostic operations
       - Document integration patterns for current and future broker APIs
    
    2. **Alpaca API Client (7 PU)**
       - Implement Alpaca API client following their REST API documentation
       - Create authentication and connection management layer
       - Implement methods for order placement, position management, and account data
    
    3. **Response Transformation Layer (6 PU)**
       - Create standardized response mapping between broker-specific and internal formats
       - Implement error handling and retry logic for transient failures
       - Develop validation for broker responses
    
    4. **Testing Infrastructure (5 PU)**
       - Set up testing infrastructure for broker integrations
       - Create mock responses for Alpaca API for offline testing
       - Implement test suite for API client validation
    
    Please coordinate closely with the Backend Agent who is developing the broker adapter framework to ensure proper alignment between components.
    
    Priority order: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4
    
    Refer to `/docs/integration/INTEGRATION_SPECS.md` for detailed integration requirements and broker API specifications.
    
    Reply with your initial assessment and any clarification questions.
