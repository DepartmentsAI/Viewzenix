  <subject>Project Initialization: TradingView Schema & Validation</subject>
  <content>
    Hello Integration Agent,

    Now that the project planning documentation is in place, I'd like you to focus on the TradingView webhook schema and validation for the Viewzenix trading webhook platform. I'm creating GitHub Issue #4 for this task.

    **Task Summary**:
    - Define the TradingView alert JSON schema based on the specification
    - Implement schema validation for incoming webhook payloads
    - Create the validation pipeline for the different alert types:
      - Long entry/exit
      - Short entry/exit
    - Set up structure for handling the webhook payload in preparation for trade processing

    **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - JSON schema is defined and documented
    - Schema validation is implemented with appropriate error handling
    - Test scenarios are defined for different alert types
    - Validation code is unit testable (works with QA Agent's test harness)
    - Documentation is updated in `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/integration/`

    **Resources**:
    - Requirements document: `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`
    - Project plan: `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/requirements/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
    - Trading webapp spec: `/workspace/trading_webapp_spec.md`

    **Estimated Effort**: 2 PUs

    Please review the project documentation and the trading webapp specification to understand the requirements. The Backend Agent will be working on the overall Flask API structure, so you should coordinate with them regarding integration points. The QA Agent will be working on the test framework, so make sure your code can be easily tested.

    Once you have set up the schema validation, create a feature branch named `feature/INT-001-tradingview-schema` and commit your work. Then create a PR targeting the `develop` branch.

    Let me know if you have any questions or if you identify any blockers.

    Thank you,
    Project Manager
