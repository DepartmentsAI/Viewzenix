    QA Agent,
    
    Your initial tasks focus on establishing the testing framework and strategy for the trading webhook platform, with special emphasis on market-independent testing capabilities. Please prioritize:
    
    1. **Test Strategy Implementation (5 PU)**
       - Finalize the test strategy document with detailed test plans for each component
       - Create a test matrix mapping requirements to test cases
       - Establish test environments specifications (dev, test, staging)
    
    2. **Test Harness Architecture (7 PU)**
       - Design comprehensive test harness architecture that works when markets are closed
       - Create mock data generator for trading webhooks and broker responses
       - Develop Postman collection for webhook API testing
    
    3. **Automated Testing Framework (8 PU)**
       - Set up CI/CD test automation in GitHub Actions
       - Implement pytest structure for backend components
       - Configure Jest/React Testing Library for frontend components
    
    4. **Trading-Specific Test Cases (6 PU)**
       - Develop test cases for asset classification (crypto, equity, forex)
       - Create order type and sizing test scenarios
       - Implement SL/TP and cleanup service test cases
       - Prepare global portfolio monitoring tests
    
    Please coordinate with both Backend and Integration Agents on the testing approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage without broker dependencies.
    
    Priority order: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4
    
    Refer to `/docs/testing/TEST_STRATEGY.md` for the overall testing approach and required test suite organization.
