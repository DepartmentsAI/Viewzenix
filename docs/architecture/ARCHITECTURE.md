# Viewzenix Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture for the Viewzenix application.

## System Overview

Viewzenix follows a modern, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

+-------------------+            +-------------------+
                                          |
                                          |
                                          v
                                 +-------------------+
                                 |                   |
                                 |     Database      |
                                 |                   |
                                 +-------------------+
```

## Core Components

### Frontend

- **Technology**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Styled Components
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

### Backend

- **Technology**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **API Framework**: Express.js
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **Validation**: Joi / Zod
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest

### Database

- **Primary Database**: [To be determined]
- **ORM/Query Builder**: [To be determined]
- **Migration Strategy**: [To be determined]

### Integration Layer

- **External Services**: REST / GraphQL clients
- **Message Queuing**: [If needed]
- **Caching**: [If needed]

## Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components
2. **RESTful API Design**: Consistent, resource-oriented endpoints
3. **TypeScript Throughout**: Strong typing across the entire stack
4. **Security First**: Following best practices for authentication, authorization, and data protection
5. **Testability**: Components designed for easy testing
6. **Performance**: Optimized for responsiveness and scalability

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to the backend
3. Backend processes requests, interacts with database if needed
4. Backend returns responses to the frontend
5. Frontend updates UI based on response

## Security Architecture

- Authentication via JWT tokens
- Authorization checks on all sensitive operations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- HTTPS for all communications
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access

## Deployment Architecture

[To be determined based on project needs]

## Monitoring & Observability

Follows the standards defined in [007-metrics-tracing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/core_rules/007-metrics-tracing.mdc):

- Structured logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Distributed tracing for request flows

*Note: This architecture document will be refined as the project progresses.*
