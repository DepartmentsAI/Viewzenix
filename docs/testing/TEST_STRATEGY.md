# Viewzenix Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Viewzenix application.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify all features work as specified in requirements
2. **Maintain Quality**: Prevent regressions and ensure code quality
3. **Validate Performance**: Ensure the application meets performance standards
4. **Verify Security**: Identify and address security vulnerabilities
5. **Confirm Usability**: Ensure the application is user-friendly and accessible

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

- **Responsibility**: Each agent for their code (FE, BE, INT)
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical components
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Individual functions and methods
  - React components (isolated)
  - Service and utility modules
  - API controllers

### Integration Testing

- **Responsibility**: FE, BE, and INT agents for their respective integration points
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API endpoints (request/response)
  - Database interactions
  - Service interconnections
  - Component compositions

### End-to-End Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent
- **Tools**: Cypress or Playwright
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Critical user flows
  - UI/API interactions
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Authentication and authorization flows

### Performance Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent with support from BE Agent
- **Tools**: [To be determined]
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Load testing (response under normal load)
  - Stress testing (system limits)
  - Endurance testing (system stability over time)
  - Scalability testing

### Security Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent with support from BE Agent
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, npm audit
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication/authorization vulnerabilities
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - API security
  - Data protection

## Testing Process

### Test Planning

1. QA Agent reviews requirements for each feature
2. Test cases are defined before implementation begins
3. Acceptance criteria are established for each feature

### Test Implementation

1. Unit and integration tests are implemented alongside code by the respective agents
2. E2E tests are implemented by QA Agent
3. All tests must follow the project's testing standards

### Test Execution

1. **Pre-Commit**: Developers run unit and integration tests locally
2. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Automated unit and integration tests run on every PR
   - E2E tests run on PRs targeting the develop branch
   - Performance and security tests run nightly or on significant changes
3. **Manual Testing**: QA Agent performs exploratory testing for complex features

### Bug Reporting & Resolution

1. Bugs found during testing are reported as GitHub Issues
2. Each bug includes steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity
3. Critical bugs block the merge of related PRs
4. Bug fixes require regression tests to prevent recurrence

## Testing Environments

- **Development**: Local environment for initial testing
- **Testing**: Dedicated environment for QA testing before promotion
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
- **Production**: Live environment with monitoring for real-world validation

## Testing Deliverables

- Test plans and cases
- Automated test suites
- Test execution reports
- Defect reports
- Performance test results
- Security scan reports

## Testing Standards

- All tests must be deterministic (consistent results)
- Tests must be independent and isolated
- Unit tests should be fast (milliseconds)
- Integration tests should minimize external dependencies when possible
- E2E tests should focus on critical paths
- All tests must include clear assertions and failure messages
- Test code must follow the same code standards as production code

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Update of testing strategy based on project evolution
- Incorporation of new testing tools and methodologies as needed
- Retrospectives to improve testing processes

*Note: This testing strategy will be refined as the project progresses.*
