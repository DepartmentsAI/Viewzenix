# Viewzenix Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Viewzenix application.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify all features work as specified in requirements
2. **Maintain Quality**: Prevent regressions and ensure code quality
3. **Validate Performance**: Ensure the application meets performance standards
4. **Verify Security**: Identify and address security vulnerabilities
5. **Confirm Usability**: Ensure the application is user-friendly and accessible
6. **Market Independence**: Enable testing of trading functionality when markets are closed

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

- **Responsibility**: Each agent for their code (FE, BE, INT)
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, pytest
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical components
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Individual functions and methods
  - React components (isolated)
  - Service and utility modules
  - API controllers
  - Trading classifiers and calculators
  - Order sizing algorithms

### Integration Testing

- **Responsibility**: FE, BE, and INT agents for their respective integration points
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest, pytest
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API endpoints (request/response)
  - Database interactions
  - Service interconnections
  - Component compositions
  - Webhook processing flow
  - Broker API interactions (mocked)

### End-to-End Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent
- **Tools**: Cypress or Playwright, Postman for API testing
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Critical user flows
  - UI/API interactions
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Authentication and authorization flows
  - Complete trading workflows

### Trading-Specific Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: BE and INT Agents with QA oversight
- **Tools**: pytest, Postman collections
- **Focus Areas**:
  - JSON schema validation for webhook payloads
  - Asset detection and classification
  - Trade-type logic and order sizing
  - Stop-loss/Take-profit functionality
  - Cleanup service for orphaned orders
  - Global SL/TP mechanisms
  - Broker restrictions enforcement

### Performance Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent with support from BE Agent
- **Tools**: [To be determined]
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Load testing (response under normal load)
  - Stress testing (system limits)
  - Endurance testing (system stability over time)
  - Scalability testing
  - Webhook processing latency

### Security Testing

- **Primary Responsibility**: QA Agent with support from BE Agent
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, npm audit
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication/authorization vulnerabilities
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - API security
  - Data protection
  - Webhook security (spoofing prevention)

## Testing Process

### Test Planning

1. QA Agent reviews requirements for each feature
2. Test cases are defined before implementation begins
3. Acceptance criteria are established for each feature
4. Trading-specific tests are designed to work offline

### Test Implementation

1. Unit and integration tests are implemented alongside code by the respective agents
2. E2E tests are implemented by QA Agent
3. Trading tests use mocked broker responses
4. All tests must follow the project's testing standards

### Test Execution

1. **Pre-Commit**: Developers run unit and integration tests locally
2. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Automated unit and integration tests run on every PR
   - E2E tests run on PRs targeting the develop branch
   - Performance and security tests run nightly or on significant changes
   - Trading tests run with mocked broker responses
3. **Manual Testing**: QA Agent performs exploratory testing for complex features

### Bug Reporting & Resolution

1. Bugs found during testing are reported as GitHub Issues
2. Each bug includes steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity
3. Critical bugs block the merge of related PRs
4. Bug fixes require regression tests to prevent recurrence

## Trading System Test Suite

The trading webhook platform includes a specialized test suite designed to run offline:

| Test Phase | Focus | Script |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | JSON schema validation | `test_webhooks_schema.py` |
| 1 | Asset detection & broker blocking | `test_assets.py` |
| 2 | Trade-type logic, fallback sizing | `test_trade_types.py` |
| 3 | SL/TP cleanup | `test_cleanup.py` |
| 4 | Limit order dual-mode | `test_limit_orders.py` |
| 5 | Global SL/TP | `test_global_sl_tp.py` |

### Manual Crypto Test (market closed)

1. BTCUSD **long market** – verify entry, SL/TP tagging, cleanup
2. ETHUSD **long limit** (offset) – ensure unfilled entry blocks exit
3. Paste logs for post-mortem

## Testing Environments

- **Development**: Local environment for initial testing
- **Testing**: Dedicated environment for QA testing before promotion
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
- **Production**: Live environment with monitoring for real-world validation

## Testing Deliverables

- Test plans and cases
- Automated test suites
- Test execution reports
- Defect reports
- Performance test results
- Security scan reports
- Trading-specific test logs and results

## Testing Standards

- All tests must be deterministic (consistent results)
- Tests must be independent and isolated
- Unit tests should be fast (milliseconds)
- Integration tests should minimize external dependencies when possible
- E2E tests should focus on critical paths
- All tests must include clear assertions and failure messages
- Test code must follow the same code standards as production code
- Trading tests must work without live broker connections

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Update of testing strategy based on project evolution
- Incorporation of new testing tools and methodologies as needed
- Retrospectives to improve testing processes

*Note: This testing strategy will be refined as the project progresses.*
