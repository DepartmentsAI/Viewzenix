# Viewzenix Project Requirements

## Project Overview
Viewzenix is an AI-driven software development pipeline where specialized AI agents collaborate to build, test, and integrate a web application. The pipeline leverages automated communication, version control, and standardized workflows to streamline development.

## Project Goals
- Develop a functional web application through AI agent collaboration
- Establish robust and repeatable workflows for AI-driven development
- Measure and optimize agent performance using Prompt Units
- Ensure adherence to high standards of code quality, security, and performance
- Minimize human intervention required for routine development tasks

## Functional Requirements
*To be defined based on specific project needs*

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application must adhere to performance standards defined in 042-red-lines-performance.mdc
- **Security**: The application must follow security standards defined in 041-red-lines-security.mdc
- **Reliability**: The application must be resilient and handle errors gracefully
- **Scalability**: The application architecture must support horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Code must follow the standards outlined in 030-code-standards-always.mdc

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: [To be determined]
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress

## Development Process
- Follows the GitHub workflow defined in 011-github-workflow.mdc
- Uses standardized communication protocols defined in 010-communication-protocol-always.mdc
- Agent roles and responsibilities as defined in 004-scope-matrix.mdc

*This is an initial version. Requirements will be refined as the project progresses.*
