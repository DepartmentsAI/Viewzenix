# Viewzenix Project Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing the Viewzenix application.

## Project Team

The Viewzenix project will be developed by a team of specialized AI agents:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Overall project coordination, task management, and communication hub
- **Frontend/UI (FE)**: UI components and client-side application logic
- **Backend/Architecture (BE)**: Server-side logic, APIs, and application architecture
- **Integration (INT)**: Connecting components and external service integration
- **QA & Testing (QA)**: Quality assurance and comprehensive testing

## Development Approach

The project will follow an iterative development approach with the following principles:

1. **Prompt Unit Management**: Work will be estimated and tracked using Prompt Units (PUs) as defined in 002-prompt-measurement-guidelines.mdc
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Features will be developed in manageable increments
3. **Continuous Integration**: Code will be regularly merged to the develop branch
4. **Quality Gates**: All code must pass automated tests before merging

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint will be 2 weeks long and follow this structure:

1. **Sprint Planning**: PM assigns tasks to agents based on roadmap priorities
2. **Development**: Agents work on assigned tasks, communicate blockers/progress
3. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
4. **Retrospective**: Document learnings in knowledge base

## Task Assignment Process

1. PM breaks down features into assignable tasks
2. Tasks are prioritized based on dependencies and roadmap
3. Tasks are assigned to appropriate agents via GitHub Issues
4. Agents estimate effort in Prompt Units (PUs)
5. PM finalizes and communicates schedule

## Communication Structure

- GitHub Issues: Primary task tracking
- Agent messages: Direct inter-agent communication following 010-communication-protocol-always.mdc
- Decision Log: Record of significant decisions maintained by PM

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Technical complexity exceeds agent capabilities | Medium | High | Break down tasks into smaller units, provide detailed specifications |
| Integration issues between components | High | Medium | Establish clear interfaces, regular integration testing |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Prioritize features, focus on core functionality first |
| Security vulnerabilities | Medium | High | Regular security reviews, follow security red lines |

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. All features in the roadmap are implemented
2. The application passes all quality gates
3. The system meets performance and security requirements
4. Documentation is complete and accurate

*Note: This plan will be revised and updated as the project progresses.*
