# Viewzenix Integration Specifications

This document outlines the integration approach for the Viewzenix application.

## Integration Overview

The Viewzenix application integrates multiple components internally and connects with external services to provide a complete solution.

### Key Integration Points

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Communication between React frontend and Node.js backend
2. **Database Integration**: Backend connection to database services
3. **Authentication/Authorization**: Integration with identity services
4. **External API Integrations**: Connections to third-party services
5. **Monitoring/Logging**: Integration with observability services

## Internal Integration Approach

### Frontend-Backend Integration

- **Communication Protocol**: RESTful HTTP/HTTPS
- **API Specification**: Defined in `/docs/api/API_SPECS.md`
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error response format

### Database Integration

- **Database Technology**: [To be determined]
- **ORM/Query Builder**: [To be determined]
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling
- **Migration Strategy**: Version-controlled schema migrations
- **Data Access Layer**: Repository pattern

## External Service Integrations

### Authentication Provider

- **Service**: [To be determined]
- **Integration Type**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication
  - Access token management
  - User profile information

### Email Service

- **Service**: [To be determined]
- **Integration Type**: SMTP / API
- **Key Features**:
  - Transactional emails
  - Template management
  - Delivery tracking

### File Storage

- **Service**: [To be determined]
- **Integration Type**: API
- **Key Features**:
  - File upload/download
  - Permissions management
  - CDN integration

### [Other External Services]

Additional external service integrations will be defined as the project progresses.

## Integration Standards

### API Contracts

- All internal and external API integrations must have clearly defined contracts
- APIs should be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)
- Schema definitions should be maintained as part of the codebase

### Security Standards

- All integrations must use secure communication (HTTPS)
- API keys and credentials must be managed securely via environment variables
- OAuth flows must use PKCE when applicable
- No sensitive information in logs or URLs

### Error Handling

- All integrations must implement proper error handling
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for persistent external service failures
- Detailed logging for integration failures

### Testing

- Integration tests for all internal service connections
- Mock services for external dependencies during testing
- Contract tests for critical external service dependencies
- Regular monitoring of external API health

## Integration Process

1. **Research & Evaluation**: Evaluate integration options and select appropriate services
2. **Design**: Document the integration approach and required interfaces
3. **Implementation**: Develop the integration following security and coding standards
4. **Testing**: Verify correct behavior through integration and contract tests
5. **Deployment**: Deploy with appropriate monitoring
6. **Maintenance**: Monitor integration health and adapt to service changes

## Resilience Strategies

- **Timeouts**: Appropriate timeouts for all external calls
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures when external services are down
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Retry Policies**: Intelligent retry with backoff for intermittent failures
- **Monitoring**: Alerting on integration failures

## Response Time SLAs

- **Internal API Calls**: < 100ms (p95)
- **Database Operations**: < 50ms (p95)
- **External Service Calls**: Varies by service, generally < 500ms

*Note: These integration specifications will be refined as the project progresses and specific technologies and services are selected.*
