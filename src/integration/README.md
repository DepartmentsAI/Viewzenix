# Viewzenix Integration Layer

This directory contains the integration components for Viewzenix that connect the application with external services and manage internal component communication.

## Purpose

The integration layer serves as a bridge between:
- Internal components (backend services, microservices if applicable)
- External third-party services (authentication, email, storage, etc.)
- Data transformation and mapping between systems

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Axios/Fetch**: HTTP clients
- **Event/Message Systems**: For asynchronous communication
- **Adapters**: Interface standardization for external services
- **Jest**: Testing framework

```

## External Service Integrations

Refer to `/workspace/Viewzenix/docs/integration/INTEGRATION_SPECS.md` for details on:
- Authentication service integration
- Email service integration
- Storage service integration
- Other third-party services

## Resilience Patterns

This layer implements resilience patterns to handle external service failures:
- Timeouts
- Circuit breakers
- Retry logic
- Fallback mechanisms
- Error monitoring

## Integration Testing

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm test

# Test specific service integration
npm test -- --testPathPattern=auth
```

## Environment Variables

External service connections require configuration through environment variables:
```
# Authentication Service
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=
AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Email Service
EMAIL_SERVICE_URL=
EMAIL_API_KEY=

# Storage Service
STORAGE_SERVICE_URL=
STORAGE_API_KEY=
```

## Adding New Integrations

1. Create a new adapter in `/adapters` that implements the standard interface
2. Implement the service client in `/clients`
3. Add any necessary data transformations in `/transformers`
4. Update configuration in `/config`
5. Write integration tests
6. Document the integration

## Monitoring

All external service calls are monitored for:
- Response time
- Success/failure rates
- Error patterns
- Data validation issues
